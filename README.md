Streamlit App for credit risk analysis

Developed a comprehensive banking anti-fraud model focusing on credit risk analysis, utilizing data sourced from the LendingClub website. This project involved several key stages, each contributing to the effectiveness of the final model:

- Application Development: Created a user-friendly app using Streamlit to facilitate interactive analysis and visualization of credit risk data.
- Data Management: Managed large datasets effectively with Git Large File Storage (LFS), ensuring efficient handling and version control of extensive credit data files.
- Data Processing: Implemented data cleansing processes using Python to ensure data integrity. This included reading data files with read.csv, identifying and rectifying any inconsistencies or irrelevant information in the dataset.
- Variable Analysis: Identified and delineated dependent variables crucial for model accuracy and independent variables to explain variations in credit risk, setting the stage for robust statistical analysis.
